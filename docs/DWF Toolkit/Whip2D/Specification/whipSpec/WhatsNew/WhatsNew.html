<br>Version 6.0
<br>March, 2003
<br>&nbsp;
<br><b>THE NAME HAS CHANGED!</b><br>
<br>
The data formerly known as the DWF file format has been renamed the WHIP! data format.
As of version 6.0, the DWF name has been rebranded and now applies to the new package 
format which is explained in the DWF specification document accompanying this distribution.
WHIP! data refers specifically to 2D vector file resources which reside within the DWF package.
WHIP! data of version 0.55 and before can (and will) be referred to as a DWF file.<br>

<ul><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New since version 0.55</font></b>
<br><i>Due to the new DWF package architecture, it made sense to move all of the metadata
and many structural opcodes out of the WHIP! data and into the DWF package.  This essentially
reverts most of the WHIP! format back to version 0.50, with a few exceptions. See the DWF 
specification and the WHIP! Toolkit document for information regarding the disposition of the 
following deprecated opcodes.</i><br>
<br>
The following opcodes were deprecated:
    <blockquote>Alignment, Author, Background, BlockRef, Block_Meaning, Comments, Copyright, 
        Creation_Time, Creator, Description, Directory, Encryption, FileTime, Group_Begin, 
        Group_End, Inked_Area, Keywords, Marker_Size, Marker_Symbol, Modification_Time, 
        Orientation, Password, Plot_Info, SignData, Source_Creation_Time, Source_Filename, 
        Source_Modification_Time, Subject, Title, and Trusted_Font_List.
    </blockquote>

The following opcodes were added to version 6.0:
    <ul><b><a href="../Opcodes/ObjectNode.html">ObjectNode</a></b>
    <br>Replaces the Group_Begin/Group_End, and constitutes an new, efficient method of 
    grouping objects together (for use by rendering applications for such things as selection,
    metadata association, etc.)</ul>
</ul>
<br>
<ul><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New since version 0.50</font></b>
<br>The following opcodes were added to DWF version 0.55:
<ul><b><a href="../Opcodes/BlockRef.html">BlockRef</a></b>
<br>DWF files can store DWF data in "blocks", each of which is separately
compressed and uniquely identified with some meta-data.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefDwgInfoBlk.html">Drawing Information
Block</a></b>
<br>Acts as a container for other drawing information opcodes.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefKeywords.html">Keywords</a></b>
<br>Allows a list of keywords to be added to the file that is ignored by
the file reading application.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefMrkrGlph.html">Marker Glyph</a></b>
<br>Adds a new glyph or redefines an existing glyph to the table of marker
glyphs.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Alignment.html">Alignment</a></b>
<br>Represents the alignment of all graphics in the graphic block, in a
certain format, on the paper plot.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Block_Meaning.html">Block Meaning</a></b>
<br>Definition field of the <a href="../Opcodes/BlockRef.html">BlockRef</a>
opcode, that distinguishes one overlay block from the other — by attaching
different block meaning.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Embedded_Font.html">Embedded Font</a></b>
<br>A wrapper-extended binary opcode intended to hold the subsetted embedded
font information as a byte stream.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Encryption.html">Encryption</a></b>
<br>Identifies the type of encryption — if&nbsp; DWF data is encrypted.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_FileTime.html">FileTime</a></b>
<br>A generic way of timestamp representation as part of other opcodes.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Font_Extension.html">Font Extension</a></b>
<br>Accounts for the limitation of the existing Set Font opcode which does
not store the canonical name.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Guid.html">Guid</a></b>
<br>A Block Guid will uniquely identify each of the blocks in a block structured
<i>DWF</i>
file.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Guid_List.html">Guid List</a></b>
<br>A helper opcode used to serialize and materialize a linked list of
<a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Guid.html">Guid</a>
opcodes.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Orientation.html">Orientation</a></b>
<br>represents the relationship between the paper and image orientation
of the graphics block that the opcode represents.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Password.html">Password</a></b>
<br>Overlay blocks like 'Seals' and 'Stamps' may optionally be password
protected.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_SignData.html">SignData</a></b>
<br>Adds support for digital signatures in <i>DWF</i> files.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Trusted_Font_List.html">Trusted Font List</a></b>
<br>List of all "trusted" non-standard fonts for embedding subsetted information
on fonts used in the current <i>DWF</i> file or on the target system,&nbsp;
using the <a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_Embedded_Font.html">Embedded Font</a>
opcode
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DefWT_UserData.html">UserData</a></b>
<br>A binary opcode wrapper storing user specific data in <i>DWF</i> files.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/Directory.html">Directory</a></b>
<br>Serves as a directory of blocks contained in a <i>DWF</i> file.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/EmbdSrcFil.html">Embed Source File</a></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">New since version 0.40</font></b>
<br>The following opcodes were added to DWF version 0.50:
<ul><b><a href="../Opcodes/OptimizedForPlotting.html">Optimized For Plotting</a></b>
<br>Gives the DWF generators the ability to choose whether to optimize
the <i>dwf</i> file for display or plotting.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/MergeControl.html">Merge Control</a></b>

in order to merge objects, whenever the drawables overlap.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/InkArea.html">Inked_Area</a></b>
<br>Specifies a rectangle, in logical coordinates, in which all of the
<i>.dwf</i>
file’s geometric primitives fit tightly inside.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/DrwPNGGroup4Img.html">Draw Group4 PNG Image</a></b>
<br>Draws PNG or Group4 formatted images either in a one- or two-dimensional
array of pixels. Also, the "Group4X_Mapped" image format extends the <b>Group4
PNG Image</b> opcode to indicate whether the background pixels of a G4
raster are transparent.
<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/GroupEnd.html">Group End</a></b>
<br>Marks the end of a set of drawing objects that are treated as a group.

<br><b><a href="../Opcodes/SetFillPattern.html">Set Fill Pattern</a></b>
