<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Overview</font></font></b>
<br>This section provides a feature overview of WHIP! and how to use the
guide.
<br>
<hr>
<p><a NAME="Intro"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Introduction
— What is WHIP! data? </font></font></b>
<br>WHIP! data is the new name given to classic DWF (Design Web Format) files 
of version 0.55 and earlier.  The DWF 6 format is described in detail in the DWF 
Specification document accompanying this distribution.  WHIP! data was developed 
because widely accepted 2D vector file standards did not address the needs of 
Internet aware applications. In addition, commercial formats were too closely tied 
to specific proprietary data structures to support the exchange of illustrations 
among systems.
<p>WHIP! data is a format for the standardized description of 2D, vector-based
drawings and illustrations, intended for encapsulation within a DWF package file. 
<b>WHIP! data files of version 6.0 and greater are not intended to be used as stand-alone
files, but rather a data channel within a DWF package file.</b><br>
<br>
This specification was developed with the following in mind:

<ul><b>Application independence <i>— </i></b>It provides application independence.
Because WHIP! data specifies a generalized 2D vector format rather than using
the data structure details of a specific application, WHIP! data has been designed
to accommodate the pictorial output available from a wide variety of commercial
applications that generate 2D illustrations.
<p><b>Compatibility <i>— </i></b>WHIP! data provides a common syntax for the exchange
of 2D illustrations between applications that generate drawings and viewing
applications that read them, for use within the DWF package format.
<p><b>Simplicity <i>— </i></b>WHIP! data provides simplicity through the use of
a flexible syntax that requires minimal information for simple cases while
allowing a graceful escalation of information required for more complex
drawing descriptions. The format persuades WHIP! data generating applications
to tessellate their geometry into a form that is simple for viewing applications
to read.
<p><b>Stability <i>— </i></b>The WHIP! data format remains relatively unchanged 
over time because it is application independent and has extensibility built in. 
Also, it is less likely to require changes as it addresses the requirements of
most existing commercial systems.
<p><b>Many Supported Features <i>— </i></b>Fully supported features include lines,
polylines, polygons, polytriangles, markers, images, circles, arcs, ellipses,
B&eacute;zier curves, text, visibility, Gouraud shading, texture mapping,
31-bit data precision, layer control, view control, clip regions, variable
transparency, and international character sets.
<p><b>Plot Utility</b> <b>—</b> The Toolkit provides a new set of opcodes
that enable realistic plotting from WHIP! data consumers.
<p><b>Extensibility — </b>WHIP! data provides extensibility through the use of
syntax extension mechanisms built into the specification and through a
set of rules for WHIP! data reading programs that allow for unforeseen
syntax extensions. For example, new operations can be compatibly added
to WHIP! data that will be gracefully ignored by older WHIP! data reading
applications.
<p><b>Compact size <i>— </i></b>WHIP! data is designed to provide either a compact
binary or readable ASCII representation of illustrations. Especially critical
for Internet transmission, WHIP! data includes a compression mechanism that
minimizes duplication of geometric information.
<p><a NAME="EmbedMech"></a><b>Embedding mechanism <i>— </i></b>WHIP! data includes
a mechanism for the attachment of any kind of data (with a link or an embed
operation) to the format. One possible use for this is to allow users to
drag and drop illustrations from a Web browser into any application. Rather
than "dropping" WHIP! data, an embedded or linked file format native to the
target application is dropped as instructed by the WHIP! data reader.
<p><a NAME="URL"></a><b>URL hyperlink support <i>— </i></b>WHIP! data adds 
World Wide Web support and features to the drawings it describes. One of these
features is the ability to attach Internet URL (universal resource locator)
hyperlinks to any object so that by selecting an object in a drawing, a
user can jump to a more detailed view of the drawing, to a related drawing,
or to any other Internet information (text, sound, video, and so forth).</ul>
</ul>

<p><br><a NAME="About"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>About
The Guide</font></font></b>
<br>This version of the Guide also expands upon the development system
and opcode library that originated with the <i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whip!</font></i>
Toolkit. This section tells how to use the guide.
<blockquote><a NAME="Synop"></a><b><font size=+1>Synopsis</font></b>
<br>The guide has one primary focus:
<blockquote>
Technical overview of the WHIP! data specification intended for use as a channel (file resource)
within a "Design Web Format" (DWF) — package.  WHIP! data contains information facilitating
the transmission of 2D vector drawings. A reference of opcode definitions is included.

<br>This guide is based on revision 06.00 of the WHIP! data specification. 
Future versions will specify additional functions that were not included. 
As such, some content in this revision is marked "To Be Determined" (TBD).
<p><a NAME="Typo"></a><b><font size=+1>Typographical Conventions</font></b>
<br>In this guide, certain typographical conventions are used to make reading
and understanding easier.
<p>The Courier font is used for methods, file objects and items expressed
in code and fragments of C or C++ language code:
<dir>
<dir>&nbsp;</dir>

<table WIDTH="60%" HEIGHT="20%" >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="70%" HEIGHT="30%">
<blockquote>Methods</blockquote>
</td>

<td>
<blockquote><font face="Courier New">process_next_object()</font></blockquote>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<blockquote>Function names (when in code)</blockquote>
</td>

<td>
<blockquote><font face="Courier New">establish_configuration</font></blockquote>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<dir>&nbsp;</dir>
</dir>
A Times Roman bold font is used for opcodes and function names:
<blockquote><b>Define Compressed Data</b>, or <b>Draw Ellipse</b>.</blockquote>
An italic font is used for arguments, values, and also emphasis, names
of documents, files, and directory locations supplied with the kit:
<blockquote>a four-bit <i>literal data run length</i> value.</blockquote>
Underlined Courier font characters indicate binary operand data:
<blockquote><font face="Courier New">1<u>xxxxyyyyxxx</u>x</font>.</blockquote>
In code samples or code sequences, the use of a C++ comment identifier
followed by ellipses indicates code that has been omitted for clarity:
<blockquote><font face="Courier New">// ...</font>.</blockquote>
Actions, attributes and references to sections in the guide appear in the
text as Times Roman font in double quotes:
<blockquote>"process", "Color" and, see the "Notes" section of....</blockquote>
