<P><STRONG>Aggregator </STRONG>- The %DWF Aggregator module facilitates the
    copying of data from an existing %DWF package to a new one that is being
    written.  During the copy process, sections within the %DWF package can be
    "filtered out", essentially deleting the section and all of the file resources 
    within the section.  In a simple case, the Aggregator can be used to merge
    two %DWF packages together.
</P>
<P><strong>Bookmark </strong>- A Bookmark in the context of an "ePlotGlobal" 
    section is simply a node in a heirarchical table of contents.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Descriptor </STRONG>- %DWF files are divided into 
    sections. Some interfaces, such as EPlot dictate that the sections represent 
    individual pages in a plot set. Each section is described in detail by its 
    descriptor file (descriptor.xml). These files contain time stamps, contents of 
    each section, and information such as the file which generated the %DWF 
    information and the units it lives in.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Document Interface </STRONG>- Since %DWF files can 
    contain a wide variety of information and files, they can be structured in 
    different ways. Each %DWF file tells what document 
    interface(s) they conform to and therefore how they should be read. For 
    example, %DWF files implementing the EPlot interface can 
    be read and written with the EPlot manager objects, such as EPlotSectionManager 
    and EPlotPageDescriptor. You may implement your own interfaces by creating a 
    contract between an authoring tool and a file consumer, assigning a TypeInfo 
    GUID to that interface, then adding a corresponding DWFManifest::Interface 
    object to the Manifest file.
</P>
<P><STRONG>%DWF</STRONG> - Design Web Format. Originally this 
    file extension was used for publishing documents to Web pages and viewed only 
    with a browser embedded viewer. Since then it has come to mean a published CAD 
    file format. %DWF files are created and viewed using this 
    toolkit or software built with this freely available toolkit. %DWF 
    files can contain a wide range of information, including 
    electronic plots (EPlots, W2D files), thumbnails of those plots, metadata 
    files, other auxiliary files which may be useful to an application, such as 
    spreadsheets or text documents. %DWF files are 
    implemented as Zip files with additional information (see Interfaces) which 
    describe the format of the contents.
</P>
<P><STRONG>EPlot </STRONG>- Electronic Plot. A file which contains an electronic 
    plot which mimics what a paper plot would look like. For example, most 
    %DWF files, when viewed with a %DWF viewer, will display a "page" that looks 
    exactly like the result of printing or plotting the page to a printer. In turn, 
    these electronic plots may be printed from a viewer, giving you the same printed 
    result you would have gotten had you plotted in the first place. Most %DWF files 
    will contain EPlot information.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Manifest </STRONG>- On a ship, the manifest describes the contents or 
    cargo being carried. In a %DWF file, the manifest does 
    the same thing. In this case it describes the document interface(s) that the 
    %DWF file supports and the contents of the file. Each 
    %DWF file contains one and only one manifest.xml file.
</P>
<P><STRONG>Optimizer </STRONG>- The %DWF optimizer is a module that reorders the 
    internal file resources of a %DWF package based on a predefined set of rules.
    Currently, only one optimizer rules file is included with the %DWF toolkit
    distribution, "OptimizeEPlot.xml".  This file contains rules which order the
    %DWF resources in such a fashion that makes the %DWF file "streaming friendly"
    with respect to its internal ePlot pages.  It places the .TYPEINFO file (if any)
    first, followed by the manifest, then content within the ePlotGlobal section 
    (if any) then content within any ePlotPage sections.  In each of the two latter
    groups (ePlotGlobal / ePlotPage), the file resources are ordered by "role" as 
    follows: descriptor, thumbnail, font, 2d streaming graphics.  This means that
    in the ePlotPage group, all of the descriptors will be placed together.  Finally,
    within like-role groups, the files are ordered by the ePlotPage's plot order
    then by filesize.  
</P>
<P><STRONG>TypeInfo </STRONG>- Not to be confused with the document type, the TypeInfo
    setting of a %DWF file indicates the paricular domain-specific nature of the %DWF data.
    It is similar to a document interface in that it provides an idea of the general content 
    of the %DWF file; however, there can be only one TypeInfo designation.  A %DWF may 
    implement multiple interfaces, but is of one primary "type."  This designation is its 
    TypeInfo string (a GUID).  The information is stored in the %DWF archive as a (typically
    empty) file resource .TYPEINFO.  If found, the prefix of the .TYPEINFO file, a GUID, is 
    the TypeInfo designation.  Note, the TypeInfo string is only available for %DWF version 6.1
    and greater. %DWF version 6.0 and earlier have no TypeInfo designation. 
</P>
<P><STRONG>W2D </STRONG>- A W2D file resource within a %DWF package contains 2D vector 
    graphics as produced by the WHIP! toolkit.  In a %DWF EPlot package, each page will 
    have one (and only one) W2D file resource with the role "2d streaming graphics".  Other 
    W2D file resources may be associated with the page (e.g. markup resources;) however,
    only one "2d streaming graphics" resource is allowed.  This represents the original
    page data as published by an authoring application.
