<h5>The HSF Specification details the structure of the HSF format and provides 
  a complete description of each object that may be contained in a HSF file. Developers 
  can use this specification to create or read compatible HSFs without needing 
  to license the HOOPS Stream Toolkit. </h5>
<h5>HSF is the format at the center of the OpenHSF Initiative, an industry-wide 
  effort to establish a common open format for the exchange of visualization data 
  among and between disparate applications. By supporting the HSF format, applications 
  are able to exchange 2D/3D models with any other HSF-enabled application. </h5>
<h5>Prior to implementing from the HSF Specification, we would encourage you to 
  send an email to info@openhsf.org so that you can be listed as a supporter of 
  the format. </h5>
<h5>Specific strengths of the HSF format include:</h5>
<h5> <b>Comprehensive</b> - The HSF spec supports a rich set of 2D, 3D, raster 
  and text primitives, and includes support for a wide array of graphical attributes 
  such as vertex color data, texture mapping, user-defined fonts, unicode text, 
  and named views. Multiresoluation objects to faciliate streaming and large model 
  visualization are also supported.</h5>
<h5><b>Compactness</b> -&nbsp; HSF supports file-wide and geometry-specific compression 
  mechanisms.&nbsp; These reduce file size and reduce Internet transmission times 
  which further facilitate streaming. </h5>
<h5><b>Application Independence</b> - Driven by the needs of a wide variety of 
  engineering applications, with particular emphasis on the CAD/CAM/CAE industry, 
  HSF specifies a generalized 2D/3D vector format which is highly tailored to 
  engineering but applicable to many application types. </h5>
<h5><b>Stability</b> - HSF remains relatively unchanged over time because it is 
  application independent and has extensibility built in. Also, it is less likely 
  to require major changes as it already addresses the requirements of most existing 
  commercial systems.&nbsp; </h5>
<h5><b>Open and Extensible</b> - HSF provides extensibility through the use of 
  syntax extension mechanisms built into the specification and through a set of 
  rules for .hsf file reading programs that allow for unforeseen syntax extensions. 
  For example, new operations can be compatibly added to a .hsf file that will 
  be gracefully ignored by older HSF-reading applications. </td> </tr> </table></center>
