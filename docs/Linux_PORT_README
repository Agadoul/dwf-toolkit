- 2009 1.21 	Jerry Gao(jerry.gao@autodesk.com) Initial Porting

===============
 Introduction
===============

This is a port of DWF Toolkit 7.6 to support Linux on 32bit versions. This document only covers the Linux porting work. Please refer to readmefirst.html for details on usage of DWF Toolkit.

This port contains the dwfcore part and the dwftk.

===============
 Prerequisites
===============

  * Linux with GNU (3.4.2)

=======================
 Build & Installation
=======================
 
Build step by step:
  1). Download code into a directory (eg: ~/DWFTK)
  2). Prepare build scripts
     cd ~/DWFTK/develop/global/build/gnu/dwfcore
     ./build_setup.sh
     cd ../dwftoolkit
     ./build_setup.sh
  3). Build dwfcore
     cd ~/DWFTK/develop/global/src/dwfcore/
     ./configure --with-zlib=no --with-expat=no
     make
     sudo make install 
     
     * Specify --with-zlib=no if you want to use the zlib in DWF TK.
     * Specify --with-expat=no if you want to use the expat in DWF TK.
    

  4). Build dwftoolkit
     cd ~/DWFTK/develop/global/src/dwf/
     ./configure --with-zlib=no --with-jpeg=no --with-expat=no
     make
     sudo make install
    
     * Specify --with-zlib=no if you want to use the zlib linked in libdwfcore.
     * Specify --with-jpeg=no if you want to use the jpeg lib in DWF TK.
     * Specify --with-expat=no if you want to use the expat lib linked in libdwfcore.
     * Specify --enable-shared if you want to build shared library, if you don't want to build shared library, specify --disable-shared.
     * Specify --enable-static if you want to build static library, if you don't want to build static library, specify --disable-shared.
     * By default the build script will generate both static and shared library, the shared library has .dylib extension.

The above methods build debug version of library. If you want to build opertimized version of library, please add --enable-optimized=yes to every ./configure.

==========
 Samples
==========

Samples are under ~/DWFTK/samples directory, please refer to DWF Docs for more information.

You can all the samples with Makefile.

Most samples are work fine on this Port, but not all. Here are the current status of the Samples:

Sample Name 			Build	Run			
DWFCore/   
Digest				Pass	Pass			
Files				Pass	Pass
Strings 			Pass	Pass
Threads				Pass	1/3 deadlock[1]
UUID				Pass	Pass
VariableZip			Pass	Pass			
XMLSerializer			Pass	Pass
ZipDescriptor			Pass	Pass			


DWFToolkit/
3DPublishing			Pass	Pass
Aggregate			Pass	Pass
GlobalSectionwWriter		Pass	Pass
ObjectDefinitionReader		Pass	Pass
OPCExamine			Pass	Pass
PublishMetaData			Pass	Pass
ReadContentDefinition		Pass	Pass
SimpleEnumReader		Pass	Pass
SimpleEPlotWriter		Pass	Pass
SimpleW3DStreamProcessor	Pass	Pass
SimpleXPSPublisher		Pass	Pass
TimedXMLReader			Pass	Pass
W2dTest_Mac_Linux		Pass	Pass	
WriteContent			Pass	Pass
XPSTest_Mac_Linux		Pass	Pass	

[1] DWFThreadPool does not work stably, hence the Threads sample has 1/3 chance to deadlock or deadloop.

==============
 Known issues
==============
  1. A lot of warnings generated while building the dwftoolkit project. This is because it defined several small classes which contains virtual functions however doesn't have virtual destructor.
  2. The samples W2dTest_Mac_Linux and XPSTest_Mac_Linux not support embedded font in Linux and Mac OS.
